## Quick start

```bash

cd sentinel-cost-calculator
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Brand customisation

Fork the repository and edit **one file**: `src/config/brand.ts`

This file contains colours, name, logo URL, website URL, default currency/region, and the feature request toggle. Everything in the UI derives from it.

See [CUSTOMISATION.md](CUSTOMISATION.md) for a full walkthrough.

After editing `brand.ts`, mirror the colour values in `tailwind.config.js` so Tailwind utility classes stay in sync.

---

## Deployment

Designed for **Azure Static Web Apps** (free tier is sufficient).

```bash
npm run build   # outputs to dist/
```

Deploy `dist/` as the static site and `api/` as the Azure Functions backend.

For the feature request form, add these application settings:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — personal access token with `repo` scope
- `GITHUB_OWNER` — your GitHub username or organisation
- `GITHUB_REPO` — repository name for issues

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| UI | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Build | Vite |
| Tests | Vitest |
| API | Azure Functions v4 (Node.js) |
| Hosting | Azure Static Web Apps |

No charting library — the cost vs. volume chart is a custom SVG component.

## Architecture

All calculations run client-side. Pricing is fetched from the Azure Retail Prices API on load; a bundled static fallback is used if the API is unreachable.

Key points:
- UK English in all user-facing text
- No hardcoded brand colours — use Tailwind tokens or `brand.ts`
- Pricing changes need a source link
